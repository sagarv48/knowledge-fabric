1. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.**
2. Please submit a confidential report via GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting or email the maintainers at `security@knowledge-fabric.dev`.

## Deployment & Security Configuration Flags

Knowledge Fabric provides configurable security guardrails that adapt to different enterprise workloads without disrupting high-throughput pipelines or large document processing:

| Environment Variable | Default | Purpose & Flexibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `KNOWLEDGE_MAX_QUERY_LENGTH` | `4000` | Maximum length in characters for incoming query strings. Can be increased for deep analytical queries or error stack traces. |
| `KNOWLEDGE_MAX_TOP_K` | `100` | Maximum `top_k` results returned by lexical/vector search. Prevents unbounded payload sizes and out-of-memory errors. |
| `KNOWLEDGE_MAX_RERANK_CANDIDATES` | `100` | Maximum candidate pool evaluated by cross-encoder rerankers before returning top hits. Protects CPU/GPU from compute spikes. |
| `KNOWLEDGE_STRICT_TENANT_CHECK` | `true` | Enforces safe tenant namespace syntax (`^[a-zA-Z0-9_.:@-]{1,128}$`). Set to `false` if custom internal naming schemes are required. |
